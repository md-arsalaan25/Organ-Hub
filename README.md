# Organ-Hub

<h2>Abstract</h2>
In the exponentially growing population of India, the demand never meets the supply. However, due to this reason one of the most afflicted industries in India is the Medical industry. There is only around 0.8 donors per million population. Therefore , to encourage more organ donation in India , this process has to be made hassle free. Moreover, if there is an urgent requirement of organs in an hospital and there is an acute shortage , then?

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Currently, in India a donor has to go through a very slow and inefficient process to fulfill such a noble cause. Moreover, the government sites are poorly designed with no proper UI/UX in the website to guide people through the procedure.</p>

<p>Also, there is no proper platform which helps hospitals to connect and help each other at times of emergencies or acute shortages of organs. There is also no dynamic database which tracks the lifespan of available organs, as all isolated organs have a death period.</p>

<p>Moreover, the non- governmental organizations who are striving to encourage people towards donation and such selfless acts need to be aided. Their purpose requires a lot of financial support and they need to be connected with the right people.</p>

<h2>Brief solution</h2>

<p>A website which solves all the above mentioned problems.</p>

<p>A personal portfolio of all the registered hospitals would be created with info about the organs stored. The hospitals on urgent requirements would be able to search the required organ and also push a request with exact specifications of the organ or tissue required on the website and all nearby hospitals and the available donors would get a notification regarding the requirement. Any hospital who reacts to the request would get the contacts and then they can coordinate accordingly.</p>

<p>We will be maintaining a database of all the organs that are available for transplant in the hospitals in our network, they will have an interface to add any organ they receive in real time with the estimated time the organ can be used for transplant . We will use this time to display the countdown that determines how long the organ remains healthy for transplantation. After the time has elapsed for the organ in the database, it will automatically be updated as the organ has expired, it cannot be used for transplantation</p>

<p>The website would take in information about the donor, take in their location and suggest them a hospital in the nearest possible location with all the necessary contact details and the legal procedures. This would make the process both secure and efficient.</p>

<p>The NGOs will submit their request for funds on the website. The template of the proposal would be provided on the website. After verification of the organisation and their campaign/program , the proposals would be submitted to our alumni network .</p>
